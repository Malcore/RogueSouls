# DS-Rogue

A roguelike game currently being developed in Python, using the libtcod/TDL libraries.

The game is a grim fantasy world, heavily influenced by the Dark Souls series.

## What is a "roguelike"?

Rogue, released in 1980, is a seemingly simplistic video game that could be run inside a terminal by representing every element with text or individual ASCII characters, such as the "@" symbol to represent the player. After Rogue, an entire genre of games known as "roguelikes" came into being. Each roguelike takes after the original Rogue in some way, preserving elements such as the ASCII graphical format, random generation of game setting or entities, or most commonly the permanent death of the player's character.

## What similarities and differences are there between DS-Rogue and the original Rogue?

DS-Rogue keeps the ASCII visuals and randomization of items and enemy characteristics, as well as a perma-death system (though a more forgiving one). The major differences are in the much more fleshed out story and the real-time gameplay (which is optional). The perma-death system is also not simply "one-and-done" like most roguelikes, but instead is a mechanic that allows the player to die multiple times, but at certain expenses. Additionally, there is the difference of having consistent environments and other emergent gameplay elements that persist through playthroughs.

## What elements are taken from Dark Souls?

Currently, the plan is to essentially convert the entire Dark Souls game into an ASCII roguelike, specifically the maps, non-player characters, and items. Many game mechanics will likely be changed to fit into the much different format of a roguelike.

## So what's the point of playing this if I already played Dark Souls?

While DS-Rogue will contain much of the original Dark Souls game, the gameplay, strategies, and overall player experience will be far different. Even if, or perhaps especially, if you have beaten Dark Souls, I would recommend DS-Rogue if you want more of the dark fantasy world, strategic real-time combat, or extremely dificult gameplay that the Dark Souls series offers.
