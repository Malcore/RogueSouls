# Roguelike Developments
 While I originally planned to develop a simple roguelike inspired by the Dark Souls video game, I am currently going to focus on developing abstract and versatile systems that can then be used in a release. Currently, I am working on translating any systems I find interesting from tabletop roleplaying games to roguelike form. This should provide a solid base to create a finished product that I can happily release.
 
 *Finished systems or modules will be listed below.*
