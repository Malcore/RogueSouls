# 'RogueSouls'
# A roguelike written in Python, with libtcod library functions usedd extensively.
# Heavily influenced by the Dark Souls video game series by FROMSOFT, 'RogueSouls' is a roguelike that attempts to mimic the extremely penalizing combat of the Souls series while still keeping true to the base systems of Rogue and similar games.
#
# Currently, the game has the bare minimum of functions. Tasks to be done include:
# Combat UI and functions
# Inventory and Equipment
# Enemy AI
# Overworld map (hardcoded)
# Locale maps (generated)
# Story writing
# Quest systems
# And more I can't think of right now
