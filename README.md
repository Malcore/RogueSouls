# 'RogueSouls'
 A roguelike written in Python, with libtcod and tdl library functions used extensively.
 Heavily influenced by the Dark Souls video game series by FROMSOFT, 'RogueSouls' is a roguelike that attempts to mimic the extremely penalizing combat of the Souls series while still keeping true to the base systems of the roguelike genre.

 Currently, the game has the bare minimum of functions. Tasks to be done include:
 
 Combat UI and functions
 
 Inventory and Equipment
 
 Enemy AI
 
 Overworld map (hardcoded, e.g. not procedurally generated)
 
 Locale maps (perhaps procedurally generated)
 
 Story writing
 
 Quest systems
 
 And more I can't think of right now
